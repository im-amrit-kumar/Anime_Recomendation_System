Anime Recommendation System 🎥📺
This Anime Recommendation System leverages machine learning and data processing techniques to suggest anime based on user preferences. The project explores an anime dataset, cleans it, and applies recommendation algorithms to enhance user experience.

📌 Features:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and structuring the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing key patterns and distributions using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
✅ Content-Based Filtering – Recommends anime based on similar attributes.
✅ Collaborative Filtering (if applicable) – Uses user ratings to find similar preferences.
✅ Machine Learning Integration – Uses Scikit-learn for data transformation and recommendation logic.

📂 Dataset:
The dataset (Anime.csv) consists of:

Anime ID – Unique identifier for each anime.

Title – Name of the anime.

Genre – Anime genres (e.g., Action, Romance, Comedy).

Episodes – Number of episodes.

Ratings – User ratings.

Members – Number of users who have interacted with the anime.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms
